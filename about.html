        <h1>About Malu-sensei</h1>
<p>What if your child learned a different language without having to resort to grammar?</p>
<p>You learned your mother language during childhood by the means of repetition and assimilation. This is how we should learn other languages.</p>
<p>Children don't question the world like adults. When we grow up and understand the logic of the world, we tend to look for a "magic formula" that explains how the language works.</p>
<p>Children are shapeable and do not possess a sense of criticism, accept suggestions easily and can believe that learning is a pleasant experience and fun. Plus, if done correctly, they do not see the task of learning as an obligation or shy away from something they perceive as too hard, since everything is challenging and rewarding as in a game.</p>
<p>My name is Malu and I've got a passion for teaching the English language. With over five years of experience across Brazil, South Korea, China and Japan, I've taught over 400 students English conversation without the use of their native language in the classes. I also make use of the Total Physical Response (TPR) method, the leading methodology for teaching in asian schools.</p>
<p>I base my classes in the everyday situations like conversation or as per the students' needs. I aim to work out of the constraints of grammar, letting the student think outside of the box and learn how to speak from memorization and assimilation.</p>
