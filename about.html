<blockquote>
<p><strong>What if your child learned a different language without having to resort to grammar?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, that's how you learned your own mother language during your childhood by repetition and assimilation - and this is how we should learn other languages.</p>
<p>My name is Malu and I've got a passion for teaching the English language. With over five years of experience across Brazil, South Korea, China and Japan, I've taught over 400 students English conversation without the use of their native language in the classes. I also make use of the Total Physical Response (TPR) method, the leading methodology for teaching in asian schools.</p>
<p>Children don't question the world like adults. When we grow up and understand the logic of the world, we tend to look for a "magic formula" that explains how the language works.</p>
<p>Children are also shapeable and do not possess a sense of criticism, accept suggestions easily and can believe that learning is a pleasant experience and fun. Plus, if done correctly, they do not see the task of learning as an obligation or shy away from something they perceive as too hard, since everything is challenging and rewarding as in a game.</p>
<p>I base my classes in the everyday situations like conversation or as per the students' needs. I aim to work out of the constraints of grammar, letting the student think outside of the box and learn how to speak from memorization and assimilation.</p>
<h2>My methodology:</h2>
<p>We focus on learning based on playful and dynamic activities in English integrating <strong>Total Physical Response (TPR)</strong> and vocalization. Having fun while learning has a powerful positive effect in our motivation, determining how much we can learn and, more importantly, retain.</p>
<p>The class activities include: games, flashcards, toys, memory games, daily routines, basic conversation and phonics. With this methodology, kids believe they are playing and have fun while learning English vocabulary thanks to the total physical response (TPR) approach.</p>
<p>I have taught through this methodology for five years. The classes are very dynamic with lots of interaction with the children, and guarantee that the lessons and knowledge taught there will stick for the children's life.</p>
