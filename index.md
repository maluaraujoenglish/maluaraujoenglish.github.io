What if your child was to learn a second language **without having to resort to grammar?**

My name is Malu and I've got a passion for teaching the English language. With over five years of experience across Brazil, South Korea, China and Japan, I've taught over 400 students English conversation without the use of their native language in the classes. I also make use of the Total Physical Response (TPR) method, the leading methodology for teaching in asian schools.

I base my classes in the everyday situations like conversation or as per the students' needs. I aim to work out of the constraints of grammar, letting the student think outside of the box and learn how to speak from memorization and assimilation.
